# Ray-Casting
**Welcome to the Ray Casting repository!** This project implements a Ray Casting algorithm where particles cast rays in their surroundings, and an algorithm draws the environment around them. Ray Casting is commonly used in computer graphics to simulate the way light interacts with objects in a scene.

## Introduction

Ray Casting is a technique used to render a 3D scene onto a 2D screen. It involves casting rays from a viewer (camera) into the scene, determining the intersections with objects, and using this information to create a 2D representation of the 3D environment.

This repository provides a simple implementation of the Ray Casting algorithm, allowing you to visualize how the algorithm draws the surroundings based on the rays cast by particles.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and navigate to the project:

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/Yash2402/Ray-Casting.git
cd Ray-Casting
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
  pip3 install -r requirement.txt
```

## Usage

Learn how to use the Ray Casting algorithm in your project. Configure and run the code using:

- To move the particle use mouse
- To Rotate the FOV Clockwise press ```d```
- To Rotate the FOV Counter-Clockwise press ```s```
